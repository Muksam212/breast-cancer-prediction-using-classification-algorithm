# breast-cancer-prediction-using-classification-algorithm

We are going to use different classification algorithm to predict the breast cancer
  a) Logistic Regression
  b) KNeighbors Classifier
  c) RandomForest Classifier

From this three algorith, The accuracy is

The accuracy of Logistic Regression Model is 98.24%
The accuracy of KNN model is 96.49%
The accuracy of Random Forest Model is 96.49%

As per the conclusion, Logistic Regression is best for predicting the model.
